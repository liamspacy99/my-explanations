<h2>My Chess in a Nutshell</h2>

<p>
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">:Chess</a> is a game I've come to love over the past years. So far, I've managed to get an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">:Elo</a>
of 1600. It's been a really cool journey, getting better and making friends along the way. Thus, I classify chess as my primary sport.

<h3>Music</h3>

<p> My Musical journey has, without a doubt, been one of the strangest. I started off by playing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano"> :Piano</a>, but then decided that I wanted to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar"> :Guitar</a> as well. Since then I have participated in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_(rock_and_pop)"> :Band</a> and a few other musical events.
